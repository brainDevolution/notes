/*
conditional statements execute a specific function based on the results of an 
outcome of true or false

a few examples of JS conditional statements you might see are:

    check the location of a user and display the correct language based on country
    send a form on submit or display warnings next to missing required fields
    open a dropdown on a click event, or close a dropdown if its already open
    display an alcohol purveyors website if the user is over the legal drinking age
    display the booking form for a hotel but not if the hotel is booked
*/

/*
the most fundamental of the conditional statements is the if statement. it will evaluate 
whether a statement is true or false. if the statement returns true the conditional statement
will be ignored
*/

if (condition) {
    // code that will execute if condition is true
};
